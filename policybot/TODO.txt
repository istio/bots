- Need a way to wipeout org and repo data. Right now, if an org or repo are removed from
config, their data stay in the DB forever.

- Giving that syncing takes a long time, often longer than the 15 minutes of execution time
we're allowed, we need some way to improve things:

    - Run the bot as a container in k8s, this would eliminate the execution time limit.

    - Allow the user to constrain the number of issues & PRs to sync per repo. For example,
    the syncer could be limited to the issues & prs opened in the last N days only.

    - Allow the user to explicitly specify the org and repo to sync within the REST API. If each individual
    repo takes less than 15 minutes, that would work.

    - Allow the user to explicitly specify what data to sync. For example, issues can be handled separately
    from pull requests.

    - Figure out a better way to query GitHub to get the data we need, rather than getting a bunch of data we
    bring in and discard. We do this for issues and issue comments using the "Since" option, but that doesn't
    seem to be available for PRs and PR comments.
